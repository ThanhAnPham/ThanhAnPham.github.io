I work in the field of computational imaging, with a special focus on biomedical imaging.
My current researches concern optical diffraction tomography and related topics.
In particular, I reconstruct three-dimensional volume of refractive indices using a variational framework.
My approach relies on accurate physical models of light propagation and efficient algorithms to solve the reconstruction problem.
