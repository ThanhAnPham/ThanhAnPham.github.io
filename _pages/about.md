PhD student in the [Biomedical Imaging Group (BIG)](http://bigwww.epfl.ch) at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) since 2017.\\
Supervision by Dr. Emmanuel Soubies and Prof. Michael Unser.
Working title: Nonlinear inverse problem in optics.

I work in the field of computational imaging, with a special focus on biomedical imaging and optics.


# Research Interests

### Optical diffraction tomography
Reconstruction of 3D volume of refractive indices using a variational framework.
My approach relies on accurate and nonlinear physical models of light propagation and efficient algorithms to solve the reconstruction problem.

*Collaboration with Prof. Demetri Psaltis*

### Phase unwrapping with deep learning
Recovering the true phase from its wrapped version (modulo 2$\pi$) sounds easy...but it's not (for some images). I explore methods with untrained and unsupervised deep learning.\\
*Collaboration with Fangshu Yang*

### Software for single-molecule localization microscopy
Anything related to 2D and 3D SMLM software with an emphasize on metrics and benchmarking.\\
*Collaboration with Dr. Daniel Sage and Prof. Seamus Holden*

### Image analysis of organoids
I develop some classical image analysis tools for organoids images.\\
*Collaboration with Dr. Nathalie Brandenberg*
