PhD student in the [Biomedical Imaging Group (BIG)](https://bigwww.epfl.ch), EPFL.
Supervised by Dr. Emmanuel Soubies and Prof. Michael Unser.

I work in the field of computational imaging, with a special focus on biomedical imaging.


Current projects
------

* Optical diffraction tomography: 
Reconstruction of three-dimensional volume of refractive indices using a variational framework.
My approach relies on accurate physical models of light propagation and efficient algorithms to solve the reconstruction problem.
* Image analysis of organoids:
