I received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in bioengineering from the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland, in 2016. I obtained my PhD in Electrical Engineering at EPFL under the supervision of Dr. Emmanuel Soubies and Prof. Michael Unser ([Biomedical Imaging Group](http://bigwww.epfl.ch)). During 2 years, I worked at the Massachussets Institute of Technology as a postdoctoral researcher in the [Optics group](https://optics.mit.edu/welcome-3d-optical-systems-group-mit) (Prof. George Barbastathis).\\
I am currently an R&D engineer in computational imaging at the Center of Imaging at EPFL.

I work in the field of computational imaging, with a special focus on biomedical imaging, deep learning, and optics.


# Research Interests

### Deep-Learning aided computational microscopy
Deep-learning based techniques for reconstructing 3D real images in microscopy ($e.g.,$ deconvolution).\\
*Collaboration with Carl Zeiss*

### Optical diffraction tomography
Reconstruction of 3D volume of refractive indices using a variational framework.
My approach relies on accurate and nonlinear physical models of light propagation and efficient algorithms to solve the reconstruction problem.
\\
*Collaboration with Prof. Demetri Psaltis*

### Phase unwrapping with deep learning
Recovering the true phase from its wrapped version (modulo 2$\pi$). Many challenges hide behind the simple formulation of the problem. \\
*Collaboration with Dr. Fangshu Yang*

### Software for single-molecule localization microscopy
Anything related to 2D and 3D SMLM software with an emphasize on metrics and benchmarking.\\
*Collaboration with Dr. Daniel Sage and Prof. Seamus Holden*

### Image analysis of organoids
I developed classical image analysis tools for studying organoids.\\
*Collaboration with Dr. Nathalie Brandenberg*
