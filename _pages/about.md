PhD student in the [Biomedical Imaging Group (BIG)](http://bigwww.epfl.ch) at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL).\\
Supervision by Dr. Emmanuel Soubies and Prof. Michael Unser.

I work in the field of computational imaging, with a special focus on biomedical imaging.


## Research Interests

#### Optical diffraction tomography
Reconstruction of three-dimensional volume of refractive indices using a variational framework.
My approach relies on accurate physical models of light propagation and efficient algorithms to solve the reconstruction problem.

#### Phase unwrapping
Recovering the true phase from its wrapped version (modulo 2$\pi$) sounds easy...but it's not (for some images). I explore methods with untrained and unsupervised deep learning.\\
*Collaboration with Fangshu Yang*

#### Single-molecule localization microscopy
Anything related to SMLM with a certain emphasize on metrics.

#### Image analysis of organoids
I develop some classical image analysis tools for organoids images.\\
*Collaboration with Dr. Nathalie Brandenberg*
