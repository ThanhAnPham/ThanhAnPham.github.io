PhD student in the [Biomedical Imaging Group (BIG)](http://bigwww.epfl.ch) at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL ![Alt](/epfl.png "EPFL")).\\
Supervision by Dr. Emmanuel Soubies and Prof. Michael Unser.

I work in the field of computational imaging, with a special focus on biomedical imaging.


## Research Interests
------

* **Optical diffraction tomography**: 
Reconstruction of three-dimensional volume of refractive indices using a variational framework.
My approach relies on accurate physical models of light propagation and efficient algorithms to solve the reconstruction problem.

* **Phase unwrapping**:
Recovering the true phase from its wrapped version (modulo 2$\pi$) sounds easy...but it's not. Deep learning is here to save the game.

*Collaboration with Fangshu Yang*

* **Image analysis of organoids**:

*Collaboration with Dr. Nathalie Brandenberg*
